A proton is a subatomic particle that has a mass of 1.67262 × 10^−27 and apositive charge, the protons and neutrons make up the nucleus of an atom. The amount of neutrons and protons are the same and define the atomic number of an element on the periodic table, except hydrogen which contains one proton.

Protons were first discovered by Rutherford in 1919 when his scintillation detectors sensed a hydrogen nuclei when a beam of alpha particles were shot in the air. Upon further examining, he
discovered it was created from the nitrogen atoms in the atmosphere, then he fired beams of alpha through pure nitrogen gas and saw that more hydrogen nuclei were produced. He concluded that hydrogen nuclei were from a nitrogen atom which proved that the hydrogen nucleus was a part of all other atoms. Later, he named the hydrogen nuclei, as we know it today, a proton.

But what if protons did not exist? Elements would not be distinguishable and elements would not serve a purpose making earth inhabitable. As shown, atoms are the building blocks of life and without the protons giving off a positive charge it could change our entire world as we know it. So if one person could give off a positive charge to others it could cause a butterfly effect that allows our world to function how it is. If there was no positive energy the world would be in chaos and there would be no balance. Positivity is needed to balance the world.
